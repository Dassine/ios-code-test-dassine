===============

For this project we created a very simple reader app that has some known problems.

1. Treat this as if you own the app, and you'll be releasing the finished product and source code under your own name.
2. Change the button at the top left to toggle between the current view and a more compact view that displays more stories at a time, but with less information. You'll need to decide how a more compact view should look.
3. Make sure to follow:
	* [WordPress for iOS Style Guide](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/wiki/WordPress-for-iOS-Style-Guide).
	* i18n: every user visible string should be translatable.
	* Security, best practices, code documentation, etc.
4. Don't be code-shy and feel free to explore other parts of the app, not only those you need to touch to solve your problem.
5. Commit changes to the git repository that we provided to you, splitting up commits as necessary.
6. Take the time you need but generally spend no more than five hours on your improvements. Let us know when you're done with the test.
